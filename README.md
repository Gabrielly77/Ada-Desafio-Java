# Ada-Desafio-Java

Java exercise completed during a test on the ADA platform. The goal was to implement a method that receives an array of strings and returns only those that appear as substrings within other words in the same array. The solution avoids duplicates and uses basic array logic to ensure compatibility with restricted environments.
